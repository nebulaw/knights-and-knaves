# Knights and Knaves Solution Explanation

## General Knowledge Representation

The game follows a logical approach where each character (A, B, C) is either a Knight (who always tells the truth) or a Knave (who always lies). The fundamental constraints are:

- Each character is either a Knight or a Knave:  
  `Or(AKnight, AKnave)` (similarly for B and C).
- A character cannot be both a Knight and a Knave:  
  `Not(And(AKnight, AKnave))` (similarly for B and C).

This ensures that our logical model follows the problem’s rules consistently.

## Puzzle 0

A states: "I am both a Knight and a Knave."

- If A were a Knight, the statement must be true. But it is logically impossible to be both a Knight and a Knave.
- If A were a Knave, the statement must be false. Since a Knave always lies, the claim that A is both is incorrect, meaning A is indeed a Knave.
- This results in:
  ```
  Implication(AKnight, And(AKnight, AKnave))
  Implication(AKnave, Not(And(AKnight, AKnave)))
  ```
  which correctly concludes that A is a Knave.

## Puzzle 1

A states: "We are both Knaves."

- If A were a Knight, then A's statement must be true, implying both A and B are Knaves. But that contradicts A being a Knight.
- If A were a Knave, then the statement must be false, meaning it is not the case that both A and B are Knaves. Since A is a Knave, B must be a Knight.
- This results in:
  ```
  Implication(AKnight, And(AKnave, BKnave))
  Implication(AKnave, Not(And(AKnave, BKnave)))
  ```
  which correctly deduces A is a Knave and B is a Knight.

## Puzzle 2

A states: "We are the same kind."
B states: "We are of different kinds."

- If A is a Knight, the statement is true, meaning A and B must both be Knights or both be Knaves.
- If A is a Knave, the statement is false, meaning one is a Knight and the other is a Knave.
- B’s statement is the opposite of A’s statement.
- The logic ensures:
  ```
  Implication(AKnight, Or(And(AKnight, BKnight), And(AKnave, BKnave)))
  Implication(AKnave, Not(Or(And(AKnight, BKnight), And(AKnave, BKnave))))
  Implication(BKnight, Or(And(AKnight, BKnave), And(AKnave, BKnight)))
  Implication(BKnave, Not(Or(And(AKnight, BKnave), And(AKnave, BKnight))))
  ```
  which resolves the contradiction and determines their roles.

## Puzzle 3

A says: Either "I am a Knight." or "I am a Knave."
B says: "A said 'I am a Knave'." and "C is a Knave."
C says: "A is a Knight."

- A's statement is trivially true since one of those statements must be valid.
- B’s truthfulness affects whether C is truly a Knave.
- C’s statement provides another layer of validation.
- The logic ensures:
  ```
  Implication(AKnight, Or(AKnight, AKnave))
  Implication(AKnave, Not(Or(AKnight, AKnave)))
  Implication(BKnight, Implication(AKnight, BKnave))
  Implication(BKnave, Implication(AKnave, Not(BKnave)))
  Implication(BKnight, CKnave)
  Implication(BKnave, Not(CKnave))
  Implication(CKnight, AKnight)
  Implication(CKnave, Not(AKnight))
  ```
  ensuring logical consistency across all statements.

## Conclusion

Each puzzle uses **Implication** to model the conditional truthfulness of statements, enforcing the rules of Knights and Knaves. By combining these logical constraints, we can determine each character’s true nature and validate their statements accordingly.
